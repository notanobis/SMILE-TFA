In the first figure the same directions are plotted, along with $\\theta=54^o$ which crosses the polar cusp.

The shape of the magnetopause is not significantly affected by this choice. Since our goal in this section is to eventually test the tangent hypothesis, the maximum emissivity is a more suitable metric to compare to the integrated maximum intensity curve.\n",

It is evident that a lot of information is being obscured by the cusp's maxima and their inward curvature. The peaks characterizing the outer boundary of the magnetosphere are not registered, as the cusps act as a \"wall\" for those radial directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To bypass this problem, we tried to utilize the difference of magnitude of the emissivity in the cusps and the outer boundary, by finding all the peaks of the radial emissivity and keeping only those that are below an arbitrary threshold of $1e-5eV/cm^3/s/sr$. This improves the results to some extent, but is not a robust enough definition to result in a continuous and coherent surface. \n",

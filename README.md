# About this work

In this project we present the analysis of the synthetic images produced by the [LATMOS](https://latmos.ipsl.fr/fr/) Test Particle ([LaTeP](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024JA032687)) model, in preparation for the [SMILE](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Smile/Smile_factsheet2) mission. You can either clone the repository of the [source code](https://github.com/notanobis/SMILE-TFA), read the online [jupyter book](https://notanobis.github.io/SMILE-TFA/Abstract.html), or download the document of my Master's thesis directly from <a href="MasterThesis_PB.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

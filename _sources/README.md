The analysis of the synthetic images produced by the LATMOS Test Particle (LaTeP) model, in preparation for the [SMILE](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Smile/Smile_factsheet2) mission is presented in this project. You can either clone the repository of the [source code](https://github.com/notanobis/SMILE-TFA), read the online [jupyter book](https://notanobis.github.io/SMILE-TFA/Abstract.html), or download the document of my Master's thesis directly from <a href="MasterThesis_PB.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

# The tangent hypothesis


Although, the question of the validity of the tangent hypothesis has been tackled by previous studies, further characterization is still necessary in order to derive the limits of the tangent fitting approach. In this chapter we will study how this translates to the X-ray emissivity that has been simulated by the LaTeP model, taking into account the evolution of the orbit and attitude of the satellite. Unlike the single point approach of A. Read {cite}`andi_2024`, we will attempt extracting the full maximum intensity arc of the integrated images and compare this with the projection of the magnetopause tangent that has been extracted from the simulation cubes.
